CKAN FOR ODM:
==========================================

This is a fork from https://github.com/ckan/ckan/releases/tag/ckan-2.3 with following additions:

* Extended .po files with translations for both CKAN and the developed CKAN theme https://github.com/OpenDevelopmentMekong/odm-localization

* Includes a patch to avoid a ValueError while indexing datasets as described on https://github.com/OpenDevelopmentMekong/ckan/issues/3

This clone has been detached from its parent in order to make automatic script-based deployment more quickly ( not having to download the whole original repository and all its branches).
